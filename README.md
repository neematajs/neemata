# NeemataJS - RPC application server for real-time applications (proof of concept)

### Built with following in mind:
- agnostic design, including:
  - transports (like WebSockets, WebTransport, etc.)
  - content types (like JSON, MessagePack, BSON, .etc)
- multi-threading
- data-streaming and event subscriptions
- end-to-end type safety
- tasks for delayed execution or CPU intensive operations
