# NeemataJS - RPC application server for real-time applications (proof of concept)

### Built with following in mind:
- transport-agnostic (like WebSockets, WebTransport, .etc)
- format-agnostic (like JSON, MessagePack, BSON, .etc)
- binary data streaming and event subscriptions
- contract-based API
- end-to-end type safety
- CPU-intensive task execution on separate workers
