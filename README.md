# NeemataJS - RPC application server for real-time applications (proof of concept)

### Built with following in mind:
- transport-agnostic (like WebSockets, WebTransport, .etc)
- format-agnostic (like JSON, MessagePack, BSON, .etc)
- binary data streaming and event subscriptions
- contract-based API
- end-to-end type safety
- CPU-intensive task execution on separate workers

## Neem CLI draft

`neem build` compiles config, app entries, plugin entries, and plugin-declared
artifacts into `dist` by default. It writes an internal `neem.manifest.json`
with relative artifact paths.

`neem start` consumes an existing built output directory. It imports the compiled
config only for app thread options, reads the manifest for executable artifacts,
and starts app workers in production mode.

`neem dev` uses `.neem` by default as a build-like watched output directory. It
uses the same manifest shape as `start`, restarts app workers after successful
config/app rebuilds, and keeps existing workers alive on rebuild errors. Plugin
dev lifecycle is not wired yet.
